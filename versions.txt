v1.0
- without any optimizations
- conditional transformation analysis is NOT YET implemented --> would kill the performance
- getPossibleExtractAttributeToOwnEntitySetTransformations Analysis is turned off --> would kill the performance
- small examples run in up to 30 seconds (see tests/testReport_smallExamples)
- large examples are not runnable in any reasonable amount of time

v1.1
- tree-pruning optimization implemented (without node ordering)
- small examples run in up to 30 seconds (globally better than v1.0) (see tests/testReport_smallExamples_pruned)
- large examples are not runnable in any reasonable amount of time
